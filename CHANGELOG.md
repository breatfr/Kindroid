## Theme v3.25 - 2024-03-15
- Add avatar circle setting
- Add an avatar for us setting
- Highly asked when i published my 1st version, add avatar chat (imessages/google messages style) setting and **REQUIRE**:
	- avatar chat enabled (enabled alone it's like avatar hidden setting)
	- avatar changer enabled to get kin's image
	- avatar changer for us enabled to get our image
Why i say avatar chat enabled even if it's logic, just to let you know you need 3 settings enabled to get really 1 setting, with all these 3 settings enabled you'll get the real avatar chat setting.
I separate all 3 to let you customize like you want.
For avatar chat: avartar zoom, circle, size, position don't work at this moment.

	- Avatar hoverzoom was enabled by default and now it's disabled by default
