2. Go on [Kindroid: Wide screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breatfr/kindroid/master/css/kindroid_wide_screen_v3.xx.user.css) website and click on `Install` on left.

3. To update the theme, open the `Stylus Management` window and click on `Check for update` and follow the instructions or just wait 24h to automatic update

PS: Normally with the v3 you won't need modify my theme yourself and if you do you won't get update anymore.
PS2: Like i put on GitHub only I don't know if automatic update from stylus will works so you'll need re-install waiting userstyles.world works correctly.

4. Enjoy :)
